# Around the bay upload your image

Upload your image and crop as needed.

The aspect ratio is set by default, you can change it manually after clicking "Set aspect ratio", but then the preview is kind of not representative of the result (which matches the actual selection).

This problem should go away once we have the basic canvas for around the bay as the image will then have a fixed size.

It is a bit rough, but it's a start :)
